# Analog-Function-Generator
# Designing an analog Function Generator 

### This project covers from the circuit designing and simulation to building. The device can generate Sin, square, triangle (symmetric), Sawtooth or Ramp and PWM with variable duty cycle. Waveformâ€™s amplitude and frequency can be adjusted within 0- 10 V and 20Hz to 20kHz range as per required.
